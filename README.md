## Duplicate Repo Folder 

Contains code gathered from <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/high-mobility-blueprints">this</a> github repo. </br>
Detailed instructions provided <a href="https://steemit.com/iota/@jordaan01/building-an-iota-tangle-from-scratch-in-python-and-flask">here.</a> </br>

Was meant to be used for a visual representation of Tangle, however ran into errors trying to run the code. </br>
Specifically a 404 error message when accessing given http link.

## Simulator Code Folder

Contains code gathered from <a href="https://github.com/ljlabs/tangle-pow">this</a> github repo. </br>
Detailed instructions provided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-O-okg0bWk">here,</a> via YouTube. </br>

Intended to show how vehicles could communiate using <a href="https://console.high-mobility.com/qdEZ/">this</a> application. </br>
Multiple errors when running code, though, specifically npm errors. Able to resolve most, but ran into a block that couldn't be resolved.  

 --- 

## Python Folder

Contains original code written by our team. Used to simulate the basics of how Tangle functions. 

 --- 

## Our Mission

We our working toward designing a simulated TangleCV environment that we can use to attempt to exploit any TangleCV weaknesses </br>
by posing as an attacker. Our research aims to prove the high level of security, as well as, efficiency that TangleCV provides.

 --- 

## Technologies

In order to fully incorporate our simulated environment we used VSCode as our coding IDE, Anaconda for package management, </br>
and github to maintain our work in a shared directory.  

 --- 

## Features

Currently we've implemented a small simulated environment using python.

 --- 

## Future Steps

Moving forward, we plan to continue improving our simulated environment to make it easier to understand, and we hope </br>
to get to the point where it can be used by other user's/organizations to show the value of TangleCV.
