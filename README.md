## Our Mission

We are working towards designing a simulated TangleCV environment that we can use to attempt to exploit any TangleCV weaknesses by posing as an attacker. Our research aims to prove the high level of security, as well as, efficiency that TangleCV provides.

## How To Run The Code

For this repo the only files required would be those contained in the python folder. The file node.py is used as a representative as a single node in a tangleCV network and proj.py is used to generate the network and maintain the nodes. Their roles are proj containts multiply node

Instructions are as follows:

Enter a character or string of characters and press enter

To exit, enter the string "end"

## Python Folder

Contains original code written by our team. Used to simulate the basics of how Tangle functions. 

Original goal was to create a virtual environment where nodes move around, and create a validation network when they come near each other. However, we ran into issues regarding nodes still maintaing their validation of certain nodes, even when out of range. This issue has not been resolved, but given more time, could be.

## Duplicate Repo Folder 

Contains code gathered from <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/high-mobility-blueprints">this</a> github repo. </br>
Detailed instructions provided <a href="https://steemit.com/iota/@jordaan01/building-an-iota-tangle-from-scratch-in-python-and-flask">here.</a> </br>

Was meant to be used for a visual representation of Tangle, however ran into errors trying to run the code. Specifically a 404 error message when accessing given http link.

## Simulator Code Folder

Contains code gathered from <a href="https://github.com/ljlabs/tangle-pow">this</a> github repo. </br>
Detailed instructions provided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-O-okg0bWk">here</a>, via YouTube. </br>

Intended to show how vehicles could communiate using <a href="https://console.high-mobility.com/qdEZ/">this</a> application. Multiple errors when running code, though, specifically npm errors. Able to resolve most, but ran into a block that couldn't be resolved.

## Technologies

In order to fully incorporate our simulated environment we will be using VSCode as our coding IDE, Anaconda for package management, and github to maintain our work in a shared directory.  

 --- 

## Features

Currently we've implemented a small simulated environment using python.

 --- 

## Future Steps

Moving forward, we plan to continue improving our simulated environment to make it easier to understand, and we hope to get to the point where it can be used by other users/organizations to show the value of TangleCV.
