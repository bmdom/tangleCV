## Our Mission

We our working toward designing a simulated TangleCV environment that we can use to attempt to exploit any TangleCV weaknesses by posing as an attacker. Our research aims to prove the high level of security, as well as, efficiency that TangleCV provides.

## Duplicate Repo Folder 

Contains code gathered from <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/high-mobility-blueprints">this</a> github repo. </br>
Detailed instructions provided <a href="https://steemit.com/iota/@jordaan01/building-an-iota-tangle-from-scratch-in-python-and-flask">here.</a> </br>

Was meant to be used for a visual representation of Tangle, however ran into errors trying to run the code. Specifically a 404 error message when accessing given http link.

## Simulator Code Folder

Contains code gathered from <a href="https://github.com/ljlabs/tangle-pow">this</a> github repo. </br>
Detailed instructions provided <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-O-okg0bWk">here</a>, via YouTube. </br>

Intended to show how vehicles could communiate using <a href="https://console.high-mobility.com/qdEZ/">this</a> application. Multiple errors when running code, though, specifically npm errors. Able to resolve most, but ran into a block that couldn't be resolved.  

 --- 

## Python Folder

Contains original code written by our team. Used to simulate the basics of how Tangle functions. 

 --- 

## Technologies

In order to fully incorporate our simulated environment we will be using VSCode as our coding IDE, Anaconda for package management, and github to maintain our work in a shared directory.  

 --- 

## Features

Currently we've implemented a small simulated environment using python.

 --- 

## Future Steps

Moving forward, we plan to continue improving our simulated environment to make it easier to understand, and we hope to get to the point where it can be used by other user's/organizations to show the value of TangleCV.
